# What is software engineering

* A framework encompassing a process, a set of methods and tools that make the
  software "right".
* Software engineering is] the establishment and use of sound engineering
  principles in order to obtain economically software that is reliable and works
  efficiently on real machines.
* The IEEE [IEE93a] has developed a more comprehensive definition when it
  states: do we ? How define Software Engineering: (1) The application of a
  systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation,
  and maintenance of software; that is, the application of software engineering?
  engineering to software. (2) The study of approaches as in (1).  And yet, a
  “systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable” approach applied by one

## How

Layer viwe:

* Quality focus
  * Process: 
    * Methods
      * Tools

### Software process

* Activities: Broader scope
  * Actions: set of tasks that that produce a work product
    * Task: focus on a small objective producing a tangible outcome

* Framework of activities:
  * Communicatiton
  * Planning
  * Modeling
  * Construction
  * Deployment

### Process model

But what exactly is a software process from a technical point of view? Within
the context of this book, I define a software process as a framework for the
activities, ac- tions, and tasks that are required to build high-quality
software. Is “process” syn- onymous with software engineering? The answer is
“yes and no.” A software process defines the approach that is taken as software
is engineered. But software engi- neering also encompasses technologies that
populate the process—technical meth- ods and automated tools.  More important,
software engineering is performed by creative, knowledgeable

* A further parameter: **the process flow**
  * linear
  * iterative
  * evolutionary
  * parellel

#### Process pattern

Much like design pattern.

* Each pattern identifies one or a set or recurring problems and provides a well
  established solution.

* They may lie on different level of abstraction

* Describe by:
  * Name
  * Forces
  * Type:
    * Stage
    * Task
    * Phase
  * Initial context
  * Problem
  * Solution
  * Resulting context
  * Related pattern

### Process assessment

It's not enough to define a process model with all the fancy pattern.
We need to monitor and assess whether they are actually respect, met and applied.


### Prescriptive process model

* A sort of template.
* Trade-off between order and creativity, between standard and suitability.

#### Waterfall model

* Suitable for cases when requirements are well defined and understood
* Linear process flow

* Hard to change requirements
* Seldom the clients know exactly what he wants...
* Too much time to wait before a working program is given to the client

##### V model

Didn't understand their relationship???

#### Incremental model

* Prototype model

#### Spiral model

#### Concurrent model

#### Component based model

#### Formal methods model

#### Aspect-Oriented software module

* Crosscutting concerts: aspects
* AOP (Aspect Oriented Pattern)
