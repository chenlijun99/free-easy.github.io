# Lezione 2

## Il modello E-R (Entity relationship)

* What is an entity?
    * An read world object **that can exist by itself**.
* What is an entity composed of?
    * Attributes (characteristic of a entity)
    * Key: special attribute that identifies an instance of an entity
        * Composite keys
* Domain: Each attribute has a domain (integer, string, etc. the values that is
  can assume, just like a math function)

* What is a relationship
    * Connects two or more entities (actually one entity works too,
    it's better to say that a relationship connects two or mroe
    entity instances).
    * Multiplicity of relationships
        * One
        * Exactly one
        * At least one (total participation)
    * Multi-way relationships
    * Attributes on relationships
    * Converting multi-way relationship to 2 way

* Aggregation

* Attributes on relationships as shorthand for 3-way relationships

* Subclassing
    * Multiple inheritance

* Weak entity sets

* Design principles
    * Be DRY even with data
    * Entity sets vs attributes: I'd prefer entity sets since it's more future proof
