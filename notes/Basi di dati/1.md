## Data Modeling

* Data model: 
    * Model: representation of something in the real world

    Set of concepts that are describing the real-world

    What are the structures
    
* Schema

    How are the structures

* Relational model of data
    * Relation: a table with rows and columns

## Abstraction: conceptual schema and physical schema

* Conceptual schema
    Want we think

* Physical schema
    How the data is actually stored in the disk

    This layer is the implementation of the DBMS. As long as the conceptual
    schema remains the same, this layer can be swapped seamlessly.
    "The layer of indirection that solves everything :)".
