Relation != Relationship
Relationship == a relationship in a E/R diagram

Relation == Table

### Relation

It's basically a table.

* A relation is made of rows and columns

* **Instance** of a relation: the actual table in the database with data in it
* Schema: specifies the name of a relation, the names and data types of each
  column

* cardinality := #rows
* degree/arity := #fiels or #columns

* Set of rows can be called tuples.

* Relational database == A set of relations

### SQL

* DQL (data query language)
* DDL (data definition language)

### Integrity constraints

* Domain constraints. Inserted data has to conform the schema's data types 
* Primary key constraint
    * Primary key: a set of attributes by which we can uniquely identify
    a row of the relation
    * Super key:
    * Candidate key: there might be many. Need to choose one as primary key,
    the other ones are marked as UNIQUE

* Referential integrity
    * Foreign key
    * CASCADE, SET NULL, SET DEFAULT
