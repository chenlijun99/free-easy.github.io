# Lezione 7

## Ripasso

* SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) (RFC 2821)
  * Used only to transfer email
  * Based on TCP for sake of reliability
  * Port: 25
  * Components:
    * User agent (client)
    * Mail server

## More on SMTP
  * SMTP interaction
  * Three phase handshake
  * ASCII text commands
  * Persistent connection
  * Comparison with HTTP
  * Media extension
    * MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
    * Base64 encoding

* Standard Mail message format (RFC 822)

## Mail access protocols

* Mail access protocols
  * POP3 (Post Office Protocol)
    * How it works
    * Drawbacks
      * Limited feature set
      * Error-prone "download and delete" mode
      * Stateless across user sessions
  * IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
    * All mail are stored on the server
    * Keeps user state across session
      * How users organizes their mails (folder, category, etc.) is kept across
        sessions
  * HTTP (e.g. GMail, Yahoo, etc.)

# Distributed Directory Services

* We access resources on Internet through URL (Uniform Resource Locator),
which usually contains a domain name. How does hosts in Internet know
to which host a domain actually points?
* DNS (Domain Name System)
  * Host name to IP translation
  * Host aliasing
    * 
  * Mail server aliasing
  * Load distribution
    * More IPs to one name
  * Why not centralized?
  * Distributed, hierarchical database
    * Root server -> TLD server -> authoritative server ->
    local DNS server (does not belong to the hierarchy)
    * A client needs to store the root DNS servers
    * The root DNS server returns the DNS server in charge of searched the
      top-level domain
    * And so forth...
    * Local DNS server used for efficiency
      * Caching
