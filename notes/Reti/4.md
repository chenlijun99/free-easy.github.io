## ISO/OSI stack (_de-jure_)

* It comprises 7 layers, from top to bottom
    * Application
    * Presentation
      * Data representation and encoding
        * Byte ordering (little endian / big endian)
      * encryption/decryption 
    * Session:
      * Manage connection session

* Encapsulation
* Structure of Internet

## Application layer

* Only hosts have the application layer
* Network devices (router, switch) don't need to have the application layer
* Client-server architecture
* P2P architecture
* IPC
* Sockets
  * Not necessarly transport layer sockets
  * We could open sockets on each level
  * socket analogous to door
* Is the IP address enough to identify a process on a machine?
  * NO! We need IP + (transport layer) port
  * Un processo Ã¨ identificato da una quintupla 
  (IP source, IP destination, port source, port destination, transport protocol
  (UDP/TCP))
* Port for HTTP server: 80
* Port for mail server: 25

* Defines
  * Open protocols:
    * defined with RFC
    * HTTP
  * Proprietary protocols:
    * Skype
