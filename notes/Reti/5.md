# Lezione 5

* Wireshark
  * HTTP example
  * ICMP example
  * Packet analysis

* Traceroute

## Internet Transport protocols services
  * TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): 
    * reliable, connection-oriented
    * flow control
    * congestion control
    * does not provide:
      * timing
      * minimum throughput
      * security
  * UDP (user datagram protocol):
    * unreliable, connection-less
    * UDP just relays application level data to IP level (network level)
    Then, Why is it needed?
      * App multiplexing (port)
      * Error checking

## Securing TCP
  * SSL (app layer)
    * Data integrity
    * End point authentication

## Web and HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)

* A web page is a set of objects
* The entry of a web page is a HTML file, which includes other resources
such as javascript, image, stylesheets, etc.
* Resources are identified by URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

### HTTP overview

RTT: Roundtrip time

* HTTP: client server model
* Flow of a HTTP communication
  * ...
* HTTP is stateless
  * Protocols that maintain "state" are complex
* HTTP connections:
  * non-persistent
    * inefficient
    * too many roundtrips
  * persistent
