## Protocol stack

## Data unit

Given a layer M in a layered protocol stack, we define:

* SDU (Service data unit): PDU from an upper layer
* PCI (Protocol Control Information): what the M-th layer attaches to the SDU
* PDU (Protocol Data Unit): M-PCI + (M+1)-SDU

When we transmit, each layer attaches a PCI to a SDU of the upper layer.
When we receive, each layer interprets and detaches its PCI. The remaining
part of the PDU is forwarded to the upper layer.

* Overhead of the protocol: the "metadata" that each layer has to attach
* The throughput can be measured for each layer.

* Packet segmentation
